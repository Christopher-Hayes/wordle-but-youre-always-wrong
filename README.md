# Wordle, but you're always wrong

A reverse-engineered version of http://powerlanguage.co.uk's "Wordle" game where the solution changes each time the user guesses to NOT use any of the letters guessed.

If the user guesses all the vowels in 6 guesses, then a new solution kind of becomes impossible and it breaks. If the user doesn't guess all the vowels, it'll keep finding words with letters that haven't been guessed.
